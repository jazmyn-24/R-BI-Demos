# r-bi-demos

This repository showcases my end-to-end analytics work across **R** and **Power BI**.  
It highlights how raw data can be transformed into insights using statistical modeling, natural language processing, and interactive dashboards.  

Projects are organized into two streams:  
- **R Projects** â†’ Text mining, time-series forecasting, and predictive modeling.  
- **Power BI Dashboards** â†’ Business dashboards that translate analysis into executive-ready insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repo demonstrates how I approach analytics from multiple angles:  
- **R** â†’ for statistical modeling, sentiment analysis, forecasting, and predictive analytics.  
- **Power BI** â†’ for storytelling, interactivity, and sharing insights with non-technical stakeholders.  

Together, they provide a **complete workflow** from **data to decision-making**.
